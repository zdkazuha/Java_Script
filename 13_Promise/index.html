    <h1>Promises in JS</h1>
    <p>
        Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous
        operation
        and its resulting value. They provide a cleaner alternative to traditional callback-based approaches, allowing
        for
        better error handling and chaining of asynchronous operations.
        A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. When a promise is fulfilled, it
        returns a value, and when it is rejected, it returns an error. Promises can be created using the `Promise`
        constructor, and they can be resolved or rejected using the `resolve` and `reject` methods, respectively.
